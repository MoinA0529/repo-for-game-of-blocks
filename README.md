# repo-for-game-of-blocks

Hey, I have added line wise explanation for the code.
This is text editor, which is with regard to a project I was doing with Prof. Debadatta of CSE dept.
The project intended to create a Integrated development environment, this is implementation of less than half of the progress of the project,

C is a object based language, I wish to take the project Game of Blocks, which requires OOP. I haven't used it in this project. Although I have tried some instances of Inheritance, Polymorphism etc.

To run the application under the folder type the following in terminal
You may also need to install gcc and gtk library.

`sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev`
*and*
`sudo apt-get install gtk+2.0`

Then run the following commands

`sh compile.sh editor`

`./editor`

I used the instructions from the following website, which contains concise resources for understanding and implementing basic glade application.
